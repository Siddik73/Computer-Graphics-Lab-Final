# Computer-Graphics-Lab-Final
A static Turtles Drawing using Code Blocks 

--> At first you need to be ready to your Code::Blocks(17.12) using appropriate Glut library file for graphical
interface running properly.

--> Create a new project in the Glut file properly and run it. If the first graphical interface runs successfully then
copy this project's main.cpp file and paste it on that running main.cpp file and run that.
-----    Best of Luck   -----
